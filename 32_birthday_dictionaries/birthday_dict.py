"""
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s 
birthdays are, and be able to find that information based 
on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names 
and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the 
user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that 
person back to them.
